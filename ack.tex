There are people in this world to whom I owe an immeasurable debt. You are teachers, friends and colleagues who throughout this journey have humbled me, challenged me to question, to create, to grow, to discover new worlds and to reenvision my potential as a human being. That I somehow become mixed up with all of you in the first place is one of the greatest fortunes of my life.
